# The Evolving Cyber Threat Landscape: A Decade in Review

## Executive Risk Intelligence Report (2015-2024)

A professional R Quarto analysis project showcasing cybersecurity threat intelligence and risk visualization expertise.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 10 years of global cybersecurity threat data (3,001 incidents) to provide executive-level insights on:

- Financial impact trends across industries and geographies
- Evolution of attack types and sophistication
- Defense mechanism effectiveness
- Incident response performance metrics
- Strategic recommendations for C-suite and Board members

## Alterations

### Adjust Figure Sizes

Modify the YAML header in `cyber_threat_landscape.qmd`:

```yaml
fig-width: 10    # Change figure width
fig-height: 6    # Change figure height
```

### Change Output Format

To generate PDF instead of HTML:

1. Update YAML header to:
```yaml
format:
  pdf:
    documentclass: article
    geometry: margin=1in
```

2. Ensure you have LaTeX installed (TinyTeX recommended)

### Add Your Branding

1. Edit `custom_style.css` to match your organization's colors
2. Add your logo by inserting in the Quarto file:
```html
![Company Logo](path/to/logo.png){width=200px}
```

## Performance Notes

- **Rendering time:** Approximately 2-3 minutes on modern hardware
- **Output file size:** ~5-8 MB (includes embedded visualizations)
- **Memory usage:** Peak ~1.5 GB RAM during rendering

---

## Data Source & Methodology

**Dataset:** Global Cybersecurity Threat Database
- **Records:** 3,001 documented incidents
- **Time Period:** 2015-2024 (10 years)
- **Countries:** 12 major economies
- **Industries:** 7 key sectors
- **Metrics:** Financial loss, affected users, resolution time, attack attributes

**Analysis Approach:**
- Descriptive statistics
- Time series analysis
- Comparative trend analysis
- Risk scoring and indexing

**Limitations:**
- Represents reported incidents only
- Actual volumes likely higher due to underreporting
- Focus on major economies may not reflect global diversity
